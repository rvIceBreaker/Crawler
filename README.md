Crawler
=======

Crawler was a project started a few years back in 2011 or so.
The idea was a to make a Raycast game engine and build a procedural dungeon crawling hack n slash game.
The main inspirations were games like Wolfenstien 3D, Hexen and Hexen 2, and Ultima Underworld.

I'm making it public for educational purposes, but I'm pretty sure the code is non-functional in most areas, as the project has been stagnant for many years.
